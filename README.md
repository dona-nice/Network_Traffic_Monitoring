# Network_Traffic_Monitoring
This lab was focused on the intercept of network traffic using Wireshark and tcpdump. It involves applying Various Filters in Wireshark, analyzing and examining various network packet headers in Linux using tcpdump. Also scanning the network to identify hosts in the local network.
### Objective
- To demonstrate how to capture network traffic using Wireshark and tcpdump.
- To become familiar with various Wireshark filters.
- Learn how to inspect TCP/IP and other packet header fields of different network packets.
- Demonstrate how to use Nmap to perform network scanning.
### Skills Learned
-  Acquired the knowledge to intercept and interpret network traffic using various packet sniffing tools.
-  Ability to use captured traffic to identify malicious or suspicious packets hiding within traffic.
-  Acquired good knowledge of various Wireshark filters that can help narrow down traffic to obtain a desired result.
-  Ability to examine a packet header from data packets.
-  Acquired the required knowledge to perform network scanning to identify active hosts in a network.
-  Ability to scan machines for open ports and services running on them.
